Most of the commentators attach the Psalm to Sennacherib’s invasion, historically, and this may be true, but the “Selah” warns the reader that the real “Assyrian” (Isa. 10:5–15) has been at work and the rage of the heathen (vs. 6) is the “rage” mentioned way back in Psalm 2:1 where the King is about to be set on God’s holy hill. God’s voice melting the earth (vs. 6) is not what happened when Sennacherib’s host was decimated (2 Kings 19:35) and he returned home (2 Kings 19:36). Jamieson, following Hengstenberg’s blind exegesis, has the “melting” refer to God messing up Gentile nations in the Church Age and before. But, at least, he tried to bluff his way through. Kroll couldn’t even bluff; he just pretended no one uttered their voice and nothing “melted.” Of course, any milk sop can get a milky application from the milk; one could say that “hearts should melt under the word of God,” or one could say: “Jerusalem is immovable but the UN, the U.S.A., and the USSR are movable.” We all know about how Augustine’s City of God was a blasphemous fraud, for our text says God will help this city. Augustine’s “City of God” was the Roman Catholic Church. If God had helped that filthy, depraved, counterfeit church He would have assisted in the murder of five million of His own saved, Bible-believing saints (Rev. 19:2). \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} }

These works (vs. 8) are not at all pleasant; furthermore, they are neither desirable nor pleasing, nor even tolerable: “what desolations he hath made in the earth.” You see, something did melt. The mountains did fall into the ocean. The earth was removed and “every island fled away” (Rev. 16:20). The context was when God made “wars to cease unto the end of the earth,” and you couldn’t possibly have mistaken this for anything that took place between Adam and Ted Turner. Jerusalem means “city of peace,” and it is called that for one reason and one reason only: because that is the city that will witness the end of war on this planet. Until then, it is to be fought over like no other city on this planet. God will do in one hour what all of the humanists and humanitarians working (and praying) together for peace could not do in six thousand years. Only war can cause war to cease (Isa. 1:28–2:4). “He burneth the chariot in the fire” (vs. 9). Not only at the Advent, but in Ezekiel, chapter 39 after the slaughter. \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

They missed it. Look at Psalm 46:10 as it is commented on in Joel 3:11–12; Ps. 9:19, 18:43, 47:8, 102:15, etc.Devotionally, we may say that God is exalted among the heathen in this age by the preaching of the Gospel (vs. 10), and He will be exalted “in the earth” in the Millennium by the changes wrought in nature (Isa. 11; Rom. 8:21). Inspirationally, we may note that perpetual activity is often a cause of ignorance. “Be still and know that I am God.” Samuel tells old Saul that if he wants to learn the word of God he will have to “stand still” awhile before he can be shown anything (1 Sam. 9:27). If the truth were known, one of the main reasons why America is a nation of Bible blockheads is because they are so infernally busy doing everything except standing still. The apostates at Bob Jones University, PCS, and BBC are in even worse shape, for while professing to be engaged in studying and teaching the Book, they are studying everything except the Book, and their “teaching” has to be limited by what the institutional leaders want the institution to accomplish in respect to finances, buildings, and enrollment. \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}
