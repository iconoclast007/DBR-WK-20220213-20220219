(Psalm 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 84, 85, 87, and 88). The sons of Korah descended from a father who perished under the wrath and curse of God because of his arrogance and pride.   As Korah was a Levite, grandson of Kohath, great-grandson of Levi, this only aggravated his fault, and typifies the sin of Israel, keepers of the oracles of God. \cite{Phillips2001ExploringPsalms1} The count of the psalms for the sons of Korah points to the number 11 as the number of the ``remnant'' as does Hebrews 11 which lists those distinct and select people know for the exercise of faith.}\\
