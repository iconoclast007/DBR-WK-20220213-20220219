    \item His \textbf{Compromise} \index[scripture]{Numbers!Num 31:16} (Numbers 31:16) (we find out in Numbers 31 what Balaam's advice was to Balam. The advice is followed in Numbers 25.)
    \item His \textbf{Consideration} \index[scripture]{Numbers!Num 24:01} (Numbers 24:1) 
    \item His \textbf{Coins} \index[scripture]{Jude!Jde 1:11} (Jude 1:11) (his reward)
    \item His \textbf{Corruption} %\index[scripture]{Jude!Jde 1:11} (Jude 1:11) (his reward)
    \item His \textbf{Counsel} \index[scripture]{Numbers!Num 25:03} \index[scripture]{Revelation!Rev 02:14} (Numbers 25:3, Revelation 2:14) (defeat Israel by corrupting them. This happens with the worship of Baal-Peor in Numbers 25. We likely see parallel examples in 21$^{st}$-century Christianity.)
