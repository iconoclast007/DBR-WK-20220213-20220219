\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.}
[5] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for \emph{there} \emph{is} no bread, neither \emph{is} \emph{there} \emph{any} water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.}
[6] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.}\\
\\
\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.}

\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.}
[11] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which \emph{is} before Moab, toward the sunrising.}
[12] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.}
[13] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which \emph{is} in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon \emph{is} the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.}

\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,}
[22] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink \emph{of} the waters of the well: \emph{but} we will go along by the king's \emph{high} way, until we be past thy borders.}
[23] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} border: but Sihon gathered all \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.}
[24] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon \emph{was} strong.}

[26] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{For Heshbon \emph{was} the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} land out of \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} hand, even unto Arnon.}
[27] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:}
[28] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, \emph{and} the lords of the high places of Arnon.}
[29] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} sons that escaped, and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.}
[30] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which \emph{reacheth} unto Medeba.}\\

\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.}
[32] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that \emph{were} there.}
[33] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} people, to the battle at Edrei.}
[34] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} people, and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.}
[35] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{So they smote him, and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} sons, and all \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{his} land.}
