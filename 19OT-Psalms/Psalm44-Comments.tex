\subsection{Psalm 44 Introduction}
The sense of the psalm is hinted at by several things.  It is, fist of all, a corporate psalm as evident by the use of plural nouns and pronouns. In its 26 verses, the word ``us'' is found 16 times and the word ``our'' 14 times. The word ``we'' is used 8 times. The capitalized ``We'' and ``Our'' are used once each. Then, there is a definite switch in content and tone between verses 8 and 9.  The ``collective'' goes from being at peace, with enemies subdued and secure in verse 8, to a  nation without a protector, on the run, and being bought and sold and literally consumed in verse 9.\\
\\
\noindent Its almost as if someone in whom they have trusted is suddenly revealed as an imposter and the group (God's covenant people) runs for the hills (see  Matthew 24:15).\footnote{\textbf{Matthew 24:15-16} -  \textcolor[cmyk]{0, 0.85. 0.70. 0.23}{When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)} [16]  \textcolor[cmyk]{0, 0.85. 0.70. 0.23}{Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:} }

\subsection{Psalm 44:19}
See references to the ``shadow of death.'' (Job 3:5, Job 10:21, Job 10:22, Job 12:22, Job 16:16, Job 24:17 (2x) , Job 28:3, Job 34:22, Job 38:17, Psalms 23:4, Psalms 44:19, Psalms 107:10, Psalms 107:14,  Isaiah 9:2, Jeremiah 2:6, Jeremiah 13:16, Amos 5:8, Matthew 4:16, and Luke 1:79.)

% \multicolumn{2}{p{4.3in}}{{Changing ``dragons' to ``jackal'' removes the connection to the ``great red dragon'' in Revelation 12:3, as well as all the cross references to ``dragon'' and ``dragons'' in scripture (35 uses in the AV). Further, truths about a creature known as Leviathan are also obscured (Job 41:1, Psalm 74:14, Psalm 104:26, and Isaiah 27:1 - note a total of FIVE references). Note that the very same word translated as ``dragon'' in the AV in Psalm 44:19 and NOT by modern versions, IS translated as ``dragon'' in modern versions in Isaiah 27:1.  Further, some of the modern versions replace ``shadow of death'' in the verse with ``deep darkness' (whatever ``deep darkness'' is.)}} \\ %\hline
