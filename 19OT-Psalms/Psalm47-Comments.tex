\subsection{Psalm 47 Introduction}
Psalm 44 through 47 are arranged in chronological and prophetic order.
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Psalm 44 concerns the Great Tribulation
	\item Psalm 45 covers the Marriage of the Lamb
	\item Psalm 46 concerns the Second Advent, and
	\item Psalm 47 concerns the Millennium and the Lord's reign therein.\\
\end{compactenum}

\noindent This is a similar arrangement as Psalm 21 through 23, which covers three separate roles (and time periods) of Jesus Christ.

\subsection{Psalm 47:1}
The New Testament believer can use the voice of triumph because of the triumph provided to us in Christ.\footnote{\textbf{2 Corinthians 2:14} - Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.} But this specific triumph is for the Lord reigning over the Earth (as described in verses 2 and 3).

\subsection{Psalm 47:5}
The sound of a trumpet is a trump, defined in 1 Corinthians 15:32 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16.

\subsection{Psalm 47:6}
The admonition to ``sing praises'' is found 4 times in the verse.  It is only found in the Old Testament, 18 times in total, one in 2 Samuel 22:50. All the other occurrences (17) are in 14 verses in 13 chapters in Psalms.
