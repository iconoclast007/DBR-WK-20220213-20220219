\section{Psalm 45 Comments}

\subsection{Numeric Nuggets}
There are 13 words in verse 13. Verses 3 and 15 contain 13 unique words. The 13-letter word ``righteousness'' is found in the chapter.

\subsection{Psalm 45 Introduction}
The passage is  understood by identifying the actors in the it and getting the events in chronological order. As pointed out by Ruckman, the events are presented out of chronological order, as in done in Psalm 44:8-9 and as in done in Psalm 43.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} Psalm 45 describes, first, events at the Second Advent (see references to the sword) and then back to something that happens before that, the marriage of the Lamb. Verses 8 through 16 talk about the groups of people who will be attending the wedding!

\subsection{Psalm 45:5}

\subsection{Psalm 45:6}
First occurrence of ``sceptre'' is Jacob's prophecy for the tribe of Judah in Genesis 49:10.\footnote{\textbf{Genesis 49:10} - The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.} The last occurrence is in Hebrews 1:8.\footnote{\textbf{Hebrews 1:8} - But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.} The single occurrence of the capitalized word ``Sceptre'' is in Numbers 24:17 spoken by Balaam.\footnote{\textbf{Numbers 24:17} - I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.}
